The README will in it's final format look like this

The title of your project will be at the top, along with a license badge, a detailed description and a table of contents. Each section is only as detailed and descriptive as the user responses.

The second image shows the second portion of the README, with sections, like installation, usage, tests, contributing and a questions section that will hold your email and github info, so that any user interested in contacting you will be able to. Instructions on how to contact you must be provided however.
